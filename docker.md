Everything else you can leave as defaults.

## Running AEM Author using Docker Container with Debugging Enabled

If you would like to start and run new instance of AEM using Docker use the following command:

```bash
docker run --name author \
-e "TZ=Australia/Sydney" \
-e "AEM_JVM_OPTS=-server -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=58242 -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=256M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -Djava.awt.headless=true -Dorg.apache.felix.http.host=0.0.0.0" \
-p4502:8080 \
-p30303:58242 -d \
-v ~/aemdesign-docker/author/crx-quickstart/repository:/aem/crx-quickstart/repository \
-v ~/aemdesign-docker/author/crx-quickstart/logs:/aem/crx-quickstart/logs \
aemdesign/aem:6.5.0
```

This will start a new instance and will mount internal repository content in a subfolder ```~/aemdesign-docker/author``` of your home directory. 

## Access Author Container logs

If you have configured your logging to output all logs to console you can see all logs using the docker logs command

```bash
docker logs -tf author --since=2019-01-01
``` 

Using since will ensure that you only see logs from specific time

If you find your self wanting to checkout internal container setup you can get bash access using following command

```bash
docker exec -it author bash
```
